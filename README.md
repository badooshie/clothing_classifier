# clothing_classifier
An application that will take a picture and use ML and AI to identify the clothing and the style.

Input will be a picture of a loose article of clothing or clothing on a person.  The application will the idenitify the clothing and recognize what that clothing is and its style.

Starting point: 
 - will try to first classify only top and bottom such as shirt/jacket (top) and pants/shorts (bottom).  Later will try to expand to accessores such as belts/shoes/hats/jewelry and such.
 - the user will be able to take an image with thier mobile phone or upload an image and have analyzed.
 - will start with python code that can do the classsifyting then wrap ito a web app for use on mobile devices
 - out put should be something like: "This is a red short sleeve v-neck shirt top, with white and black plaid shorts"
 - Later will try to implement recomendations such as: "This is a red short sleeve, this can be used with [inserts style and color] style, and goes well with [inserts style and color] pants


TODO List:
 - research clothing styles, get simple list of tops and bottoms
 - research classifier to use
 - research how to incorperate python into web-app
